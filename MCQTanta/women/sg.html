  <p>611. A 26-year-old primigravid woman at 41 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. Pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled corticosteroids. She has had two surgeries in the past to repair multiple lower limb and pelvis fractures that were the result of a car accident. She is otherwise healthy. Her temperature is 37.2Â°C and blood pressure is 108/70 mmHg. Examination shows the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -4 station, with the occiput in the anterior position. Uterine activity is measured at 275 MVUs. Maternal pushing occurs during the contractions. Fetal heart tracing is 166/min and reactive with no decelerations. Epidural anesthesia is initiated for pain relief. After 4 hours of pushing, the vertex is found to be at -4 station, with increasing strength and rate of uterine contractions; fetal heart tracing shows late decelerations.

  <p>612. A 30-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 40 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. Pregnancy was complicated by iron deficiency anemia treated with iron supplements. At the beginning of the first stage of labor, there are coordinated, regular, rhythmic contractions of high intensity that occur approximately every 10 minutes. Four hours later, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. Over the next two hours, there is minimal change in fetal descent; vertex is still at -1 station. Fetal birth weight is estimated at the 75th percentile. The fetal heart rate is 145/min and is reactive with no decelerations. Contractions occur approximately every 2 minutes with adequate pressure. Epidural anesthesia was not given, as the patient is coping well with pain.

  <p>613. A 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 42 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. Pregnancy has been complicated by gestational diabetes, for which she has been receiving insulin injections. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Her pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 135/80 mmHg. The fetal heart rate tracing shows a baseline heart rate of 145/min and moderate variation with frequent accelerations and occasional early decelerations. She undergoes an elective repeat lower segment transverse cesarean section with complete removal of the placenta. Shortly after the operation, she starts having heavy uterine bleeding with passage of clots. Examination shows a soft uterus on palpation. Her bleeding continues despite fundal massage and the use of packing, oxytocin, misoprostol, and carboprost. Her pulse rate is now 120/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 90/70 mmHg. Her hemoglobin is 8 g/dL, hematocrit is 24%, platelet count is 120,000/mm3, prothrombin time is 11 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds.
