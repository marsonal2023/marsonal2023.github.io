The world Health Organization (WHO) surgical safety checklist is an example of a widely used one. In brief the important issues to be covered are: • Checking the identity of the patient. Operating on the wrong patient is a grave medico-legal problem. • Checking the type of operation and its site, which should be marked with a skin marker. • Checking the consent. • Checking the administration of necessary medications and that the patient is fasting for a suitable period (There is no need for fasting with local anaesthesia). • Checking for allergy, expected anaesthetic difficulties and expected need for blood transfusion. • Checking to ensure effective communication between team members (surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses and technicians). • Checking to ensure that there are no missed sponges or instruments in the patient's body.">

<div class="category-content">
<div class="question" data-answer="2" data-note="Surgery in the elderly, which is also called geriatric surgery, is difficult to define. The age limit is increasing, but for the time being, the American College of Surgeons define it as surgery for those at 65 years or more. With age, the size and volume of the kidney decrease. There is decrease in the nephron mass as well as the number of glomeruli. This results in reduction of the glomerular filtration rate. Furthermore, reduction of the cardiac output with age, reduces renal blood flow and further reduces the glomerular filtration rate.">

<div class="question" data-answer="3" data-note="In the geriatric age group, the presentation of surgical problems may be milder or different from that of the younger population. This may lead to delays in diagnosis. In appendicitis, for example, a classic presentation occurs in less than one-third of elderly patients, resulting in about 50% incidence of perforation.

In a clean incised wound, cut tendons and nerves are primarily repaired (in the same session as wound repair). In a lacerated wound, however, the viability of their edges is frequently difficult to assess, and if judged so, their repair can be postponed to a later date. Muscle injury is commonly followed with oedema and haematomas. The deep fascia is a tough non-compliant layer, and therefore, its closure over injured muscle is likely to raise tissue pressure in such a tight compartment. This is called "compartment syndrome" and is likely to compress and close blood vessels.">

The condition is more prevalent in dark races. Its commonest site is the pre-sternal skin. A median sternotomy incision, that is commonly used to operate on the heart, is very likely to develop a keloid. There is no need for wide resection as it is not a malignant neoplasm.

Early breast cancer appears on mammography as a spots of microcalcification. The sensitivity of mammography in diagnosis of breast cancer is in direct proportion to the age and is indirectly proportionate to the breast density.

<div class="question" data-answer="3" data-note="In a case of breast cancer clinical assessment of the axillary lymph nodes is known to be notoriously inaccurate. Sometimes palpable nodes turn out to be negative for malignancy. More frequently, malignant axillary nodes cannot be felt by the examiner. Ultrasound examination is a useful aid for preoperative evaluation of the axilla. Prognosis is affected by the number of affected nodes. The larger the number and the higher the level of affected nodes, the worse is the prognosis. The presence of malignancy in the axillary lymph nodes is an indication for a high possibility of distant spread. In a patient with early breast cancer, even with no evidence of distant spread, the detection of axillary node deposits is an indication for chemotherapy in order to kill possible distant micrometastases that could not be seen by imaging studies. When the axillary nodes are removed, irradiation of the axilla is contraindicated as it dramatically raises the possibility of arm oedema.

Histopathology assesses both cellular morphology and tissue architecture, i.e., how cells are arranged, either making glandular structures or just formless sheets and more importantly invasion of the basement membrane. On the other hand, cytology that is obtained by a fine needle requires examination of cells. FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) retrieves cells from the tumour. Examination of these cells cannot assess architecture but depends only on the presence of malignant criteria in cell morphology, e.g., pleomorphism, large nuclei and multiple nucleoli. Histopathology is, therefore, more accurate as it depends on both cellular morphology and tissue architecture. Core biopsy, e.g., by a Tru-cut needle obtains a core of tissue under local anaesthesia. This tissue is suitable for histopathology examination. Ultrasound guidance improves its accuracy in hitting the most suspected area.

Hypoprothrombinaemia impairs coagulation. The presence of bile salts in the intestine prevents migration of intestinal bacteria to the bloodstream. In a patient with obstructive jaundice, the absence of bile salts in the intestine predisposes to bacterial migration and the development of septicaemia.

If shock persists, muscles become ischaemic. Still, if shock persists, viscera are affected. The last organs to be affected are the noble organs; heart and brain. Hypoxia drives the tissues into anaerobic metabolism. This results in production of lactic acid, which causes metabolic acidosis. Cardiogenic shock is characterized by reduction of stroke volume, and consequently cardiac output. Causes of cardiogenic shock are cardiac tamponade, massive myocardial ischaemia and severe arrhythmias.

Carbon dioxide is an inert gas that allows safe use of electrocautery. It is, therefore, the standard choice for creating pneumoperitoneum. Previous abdominal surgery is not a contraindication but needs more caution while doing laparoscopy. This is because intestinal adhesions to the abdominal wall are likely to be present. There are ways to avoid intestinal injury in such cases. Examples are: Insufflate the abdomen and introduce the first trocar away from the scar. Access the peritoneal cavity by a small incision in order to place the first trocar under direct vision. Use an optical trocar. Laparoscopy certainly causes much less pain than laparotomy.

<div class="question" data-answer="1" data-note=" A hernia with a wide neck is less prone to strangulation, but is not immune against this complication, particularly if there are adhesions and loculations within the sac. If the defect is big, direct approximation of aponeurotic edges by sutures puts tension on the repair and predisposes to recurrence. Overlap repair certainly causes more tension. This is why it has no place in modern surgical practice. Repair without tension requires the use of a synthetic mesh to bridge the defect. It acts as scaffolding that permits growth of fibrous tissue through its pores. An absorbable mesh, like polygalactin provides short-term support only. In order to prevent recurrence a non¬absorbable mesh, like polypropylene, is used to provide permanent support to the abdominal wall. Surgical r©pair is not urgent as the hernia is uncomplicated. ">

<div class="question" data-answer="2" data-note=" C. The commonest cause of hypoparathyroidism is removal or devascularization of the parathyroid glands at thyroidectomy. If a parathyroid gland is inadvertently removed, it should be immediately cut into 1mm pieces and implanted in pockets in the sternomastoid muscle. The old teaching of thyroidectomy recommended that the inferior thyroid arteries are to be ligated away from the thyroid gland in order to avoid injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. We now realize that this technique exposes the parathyroids to ischaemia because the inferior thyroid artery is usually the main blood supply of the parathyroids. The modern recommendation is to ligate and divide the tertiary branches of the artery just on the surface of the thyroid, i.e., after the take off of the parathyroid branches. The condition usually presents between days 2-5 after the operation, and sometimes earlier. The earliest symptom of hypocalcaemia is circumoral and peripheral numbness. Latent tetany can be revealed by inflating the sphygmomanometer cuff around the arm (Trosseau's sign). This stage should be treated with oral calcium and vitamin D3. Left untreated the patient develops tetany in the form of carpopedal spasm; a condition that requires the addition of IV calcium.">

<div class="question" data-answer="1" data-note=" An inherent disadvantage of laparoscopic surgery is poor haemostatic ability in comparison with open surgery. Continuous flooding of the field with blood impairs visualization. Furthermore, if the patient is in hypovolaemic shock laparoscopy is contraindicated as gas insufflation of the peritoneum compresses the inferior vena cava and dangerously reduces venous return. On the other hand, laparoscopy is a good approach to peptic ulcer perforation. Another difference between surgery for perforation and that for bleeding is the addition of a definitive procedure for ulcer treatment. For a bleeding ulcer, the distal stomach and first part of duodenum are opened along their axis to expose the bleeder which is underrun with sutures. A truncal vagotomy is done. The gastro-duodenal incision is closed in the opposite direction to provide wide gastric drainage. The definitive operation is, thus, truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty. This addition is better avoided in cases of perforation because the patient with peritonitis is less able to stand a long procedure.

<div class="question" data-answer="3" data-note=" Peritonitis and subsequent septicaemia constitute the main threat to intestinal injury victims. In most of these cases blood loss is of secondary importance. Compare this with solid organ injury, e.g., that of the spleen, liver and kidneys. The main threat in cases of solid organ injuries is bleeding. As the colon is more heavily populated with bacteria than the small intestine, colonic injuries carry a higher risk of severe peritonitis. Transverse mesenteric tears that run parallel to the bowel cut more vessels and are, consequently, more likely to produce intestinal ischaemia and gangrene. The small intestine is mobile on its mesentery. Adhesions convert it into a fixed target during the introduction of pneumoperitoneum needle or the trocar at laparoscopy, and make it more susceptible to injury.">

<div class="question" data-answer="0" data-note=" The internal anal sphincter is the thickened extension of inner circular muscle layer of the rectum. Hence, it is formed of involuntary visceral muscles that are under autonomic control. It contributes about 80% of the resting anal canal pressure. The puborectalis muscle forms a sling that pulls the anorectal junction forwards to maintain its right angle. This is an important mechanism that maintains continence. In response to rectal distension by stools or flatus, the internal sphincter relaxes allowing a small sample of these rectal contents to enter the upper anal canal. The sensitive epithelium in this area can discern its type whether it being flatus, liquid, or solid stools. If the circumstances are convenient, the subject relaxes the puborectalis thus widening the anorectal angle, and also relaxes the external sphincter. Straining will expel the rectal contents to the outside. If the subject does not wish to evacuate the rectum, the puborectalis and the external sphincter contract to push the sample of luminal contents upwards.">

The commonest position in the anal canal circumference is the midline posteriorly. As the lower half of the anal canal contains sensory nerves that conduct pain sensation, passage of stools induces intense anal pain. The lower part of the internal sphincter goes into reflex spasm to guard against such a painful act. With an acute fissure, the intense internal sphincter spasm usually does not allow visualization of the fissure by the surgeon. An acute fissure has neither sentinel pile nor hypertrophied anal papilla. These are features of a chronic fissure.

<div class="question" data-answer="3" data-note=" A chronic anal fissure goes into remissions and exacerbations of pain. Usually the exacerbations are initiated by the passage of a hard motion. A chronic fissure produces spasm of the internal sphincter; but it is not as intense as that cause by an acute fissure. This moderate sphincter spasm does not prevent visualization of the longitudinal crack when the edges of the anal verge are gently parted away. By far, the commonest site is the midline posteriorly. An anterior midline fissure is less common and is more frequently seen in females than in males. A chronic fissure is characterized by induration (as a result of fibrosis). It may also have a sentinel pile at its lower end (at anal verge) and a hypertrophied anal papilla at its upper end. A chronic fissure responds less favourably to conservative treatment that was described for an acute one. However, conservative treatment should be offered because if strictly followed it heals a large number of cases. In case of failure, the usual operation is lateral internal sphincterotomy. The spastic lower part of internal sphincter is divided in either the left or the right lateral position. This brings immediate marked reduction of pain and allows healing of the fissure.">

Flow in the main two sources of blood to the liver; namely the hepatic artery and the portal vein is stopped. This manoeuvre allows the surgeon to localize bleeding points and to control them. Firm packing of liver lacerations is a useful method in the haemodynamically unstable patient. It controls bleeding in a short time. The patient is then transferred to ICU for stabilization. Within 24-48 hours a stable patient is returned to the operating theatre for removal of the packs and definitive control of bleeding. This is an example of a policy that is called "damage control surgery", a policy that results in better survival of the severely injured trauma victim. If possible, suturing a liver tear is better avoided as blood accumulates in the resulting cavity and can get access to torn bile ducts. The resulting haemobilia can cause biliary obstruction.">

It also provides a rough idea about the separate functions of each kidney. In a normal kidney a renal blush (contrast that is filtered in the cortical tubules) shows within one minute of IV injection of the contrast. The calyces and renal pelvis start to appear within five minutes and the ureters start to show at 10-13 minutes of injection. In a kidney with impaired function these intervals are prolonged. The delay is roughly proportionate to the degree of renal functional impairment. CT is far better than IVU in the diagnosis and staging of hypernephroma. Emergency IVU is useful in the diagnosis of patients with renal colic, though this is now superseded with spiral CT scan (without contrast), which is better able to detect small stones.

As a general rule arterial repair requires rigid fixation of the fracture that caused it. Otherwise, the vascular repair is threatened by failure. The femoral shaft is surrounded by strong muscles that can re-displace the fracture if it is fixed in plaster. Traction requires lying down in a hospital bed for a long time. Internal metal fixation solves these problems. Internal fixation is generally contraindicated in cases of compound fractures. These fractures are contaminated. The insertion of a metal prosthesis in such a wound promotes infection. If rigid immobilization is required, external metal fixation is a suitable alternative.  ">
