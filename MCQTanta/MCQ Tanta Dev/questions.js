The age limit is increasing, but for the time being, the American College of Surgeons define it as surgery for those at 65 years or more. With age, the size and volume of the kidney decrease. There is decrease in the nephron mass as well as the number of glomeruli. This results in reduction of the glomerular filtration rate. Furthermore, reduction of the cardiac output with age, reduces renal blood flow and further reduces the glomerular filtration rate.",

One can differentiate between them at a glance by looking for dyspnea. Tension pneumothorax patients have marked dyspnea (then find out its other manifestations as deviated trachea and bulging tympanitic one side of the chest), while tamponade patients should be breathing easily. For cardiac tamponade do not send the patients to radiology room for diagnosis. Patients should have immediate evacuation of blood by inserting a cannula in pericardium. This is followed by IV fluids (despite high CVP), while taking them to the operating room for median sternotomy in order to stop bleeding.",

    "note": "Debridement entails removal of foreign material and unhealthy tissues (ischaemic or dead) from a lacerated or crushed wound. Surgical debridement requires liberal washing of the wound with saline, removal of foreign particles, and excision of crushed and dead tissues. This procedure leaves healthy wound edges that are ready for healing. Chemical debridement is a slower process that entails the application of ointments that contain proteolytic enzymes. A clean incised wound does not contain foreign bodies (as the name clean indicates) and the wound edges are already well-vascularised. In a clean incised wound, cut tendons and nerves are primarily repaired (in the same session as wound repair). In a lacerated wound, however, the viability of their edges is frequently difficult to assess, and if judged so, their repair can be postponed to a later date. Muscle injury is commonly followed with oedema and haematomas. The deep fascia is a tough non-compliant layer, and therefore, its closure over injured muscle is likely to raise tissue pressure in such a tight compartment. This is called \"compartment syndrome\" and is likely to compress and close blood vessels.",

If the scar contains a big amount of fibrous tissue, commonly as a result of healing by secondary intention, this leads to marked scar contracture. In addition to its unsatisfactory appearance another problem arises when this scar is crossing a joint because it impairs joint mobility, e.g., a contracted scar that crosses vertically in front of the elbow joint limits its full extension. A scar is known to never regain the original tensile strength of the tissue before its injury. A superficial burn damages part of the epithelium only. The remaining epithelial cells creep to cover the denuded areas, i.e., it heals purely by epithelialisation. Granulation tissue is not involved in this process, hence no fibrous tissue and no scars at all. A scar is devoid of all skin appendages, namely, hairs, sweat glands and sebaceous glands.",

The condition is more prevalent in dark races. Its commonest site is the pre-sternal skin. A median sternotomy incision, that is commonly used to operate on the heart, is very likely to develop a keloid. There is no need for wide resection as it is not a malignant neoplasm.

In the breast a chronic abscess is difficult to distinguish from cancer. Weaning the baby is not necessary, particularly if the infant is a few months old. The patient can nurse it from the healthy breast. When the abscess is drained the patient evacuates milk from the affected side by a breast pump until it is convenient to her to nurse the baby from this side as well. An acute abscess is very tender.

A common presentation is that of an apprehensive woman who presents with a history of very recent development of a lump. The patient is usually certain that it has not been there the day before. Clinical examination, supported by breast ultrasound confirms the diagnosis of fibrocystic breast disease. Assurance and aspiration bring relief. A cyst is sometimes malignant. Malignant potential has no relation to the tension within the cyst. The presence of multiple cysts usually favours a benign nature. Malignancy is suspected under three conditions. • If the lump does not totally disappear after complete aspiration of fluid • If the aspirate is blood-stained • If the cyst fills again shortly (within days) after aspiration Under the above conditions biopsy should be taken, either an excision biopsy or ultrasound-guided Tru-cut of any solid component within the cyst.",

Breast cancer appears as a dense opacity that has an indefinite outline from which irregular spicules penetrate into the surrounding breast tissue. Accuracy of diagnosis is markedly enhanced when combined with the clinical picture and a biopsy, e.g., Tru-cut. The combination of clinical assessment, imaging and biopsy is called triple test. When the three parts of the test are concordant with cancer, the diagnosis is confirmed and management proceeds according to the stage. • Screening of asymptomatic females, particularly those who are at risk, namely, those with a mother or sister who had breast cancer, those who had previous treatment of cancer on one side, and those who are BRCA positive. Early breast cancer appears on mammography as a spots of microcalcification. The sensitivity of mammography in diagnosis of breast cancer is in direct proportion to the age and is indirectly proportionate to the breast density. This means that in a young female the breast parenchyma is too dense to allow for easy spotting of cancer opacity on a mammogram. With advancement of age, the breast parenchyma atrophies and detection of cancer becomes easier. This is why the addition of ultrasound examination improves diagnosis, particularly in young females.",

On the other hand, cytology that is obtained by a fine needle requires examination of cells. FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) retrieves cells from the tumour. Examination of these cells cannot assess architecture but depends only on the presence of malignant criteria in cell morphology, e.g., pleomorphism, large nuclei and multiple nucleoli. Histopathology is, therefore, more accurate as it depends on both cellular morphology and tissue architecture. Core biopsy, e.g., by a Tru-cut needle obtains a core of tissue under local anaesthesia. This tissue is suitable for histopathology examination. Ultrasound guidance improves its accuracy in hitting the most suspected area.

    "note": "Breast cancer cells frequently have receptors that hormones or other proteins can stick to and excite the malignancy to grow. A pathologist examines the cancer tissue to find out if receptors are present. About 70% of breast cancers have estrogen receptors and are called estrogen receptor (ER) positive. About 65% of these are also progesterone receptor (PR) positive. Receptor positive cancers respond well to treatment with hormonal therapies. They have better prognosis because if the cancer is hormone-receptor-negative, hormonal therapy is unlikely to be of benefit. Hormone receptor status has no relation to the response to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Some breast cancers have large numbers of receptors for the protein HER2 (human epidermal growth factor 2). They are labeled HER2 positive. About 15% of women with early breast cancer are HER2 positive. A drug called trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a useful treatment for these cases.",

This nerve descends in the neck then loops up to supply muscles that supply the lower lip and chin. The zygomatic branch of the facial nerve controls the closure of the eyelids and is too far away from the incision to be injured. The hypoglossal nerve (12th cranial) lies deep to the deep part of the gland. Its injury causes paralysis of the ipsilateral half of the tongue. When the tongue is protruded it deviates to the side of the operation. The lingual nerve is also related to the deep part of the gland, and more so to its duct.

Fortunately, a pleomorphic adenoma is usually present in the part of the parotid that is superficial to the facial nerve. This allows its removal while preserving the nerve. Though benign, the capsule is incomplete and allows the extension of the neoplasm into the surrounding tissues. This is why enucleation of the tumor can be followed by recurrence. The tumor, therefore, has to be removed with a safety margin. This usually necessitates the removal of the whole part of the gland that is superficial to the facial nerve. The operation is called superficial parotidectomy. Long-standing pleomorphic adenomas can turn into adenocarcinoma.",

A combination of infection and obstruction is very dangerous as the cholangitis will rapidly progress to liver abscesses and to septicaemia. The situation is comparable to that of the urinary tract where a combination of obstruction and infection is very harmful to kidney function, causes severe pyelonephritis and pyonephrosis, and also causes septicaemia. Bleeding is likely to occur at papillotomy, particularly if hypoprothrombinaemia of obstructive jaundice is not corrected.",

The majority of gal bladder stones are asymptomatic. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, which is widely used to treat renal stones, is not suitable for gallstones. For one reason fragmentation of the stone is not easy. The stone, when hit by the shock wave, bounces to and fro in the capacious gallbladder. This is in contrast to the confined space of the renal pelvis. More important, if ESWL succeeds in fragmenting a gallbladder stone, the fragments can easily migrate to the common bile duct. Duct stones are far more serious than gallbladder stones. They are likely to cause obstructive jaundice, acute cholangitis and acute pancreatitis. Any of these complications can be fatal.",

Staging laparotomy consisted of wedge biopsy of the liver, splenectomy, biopsy of intra-abdominal lymph nodes, and biopsy of bone marrow from the iliac crest. Currently staging is done nonoperatively, making use of CT imaging. Hodgkin's disease stages are • Stage I: Single involved lymph node group. • Stage II: Two or more involved lymph node groups limited to one side of the diaphragm. • Stage III: Involvement on both sides of the diaphragm with or without splenic involvement. • Stage IV: Extralymphatic spread including liver, lung, bone marrow, skin, gut, and central nervous system. Hodgkin's lymphoma is treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

These are either partially digested or elemental formulae that require no digestion and are, therefore, ready for absorption. Blenderised food is not tolerated.

    "note": " Both continuous and interrupted sutures are suitable for linea alba closure. What is important is to take wide bites, at least 1cm from its edge with non-absorbable material. Polypropylene sutures are monofilament and non-absorbable. They are, therefore, perfect for this task. The parietal peritoneum can be left without closure. It does not add to the wound's tensile strength. The peritoneum actually regenerates to bridge any defect, without suturing, within 1-2 days. Furthermore, its suturing creates an ischaemic line that invites adhesions to the omentum and intestine. As a rule, no sutures, anywhere in the body, are to be taken under tension. Tension causes tissue ischaemia and finally sutures will cut through this friable ischaemic tissue, leading to incisional hernia or burst abdomen.",

    "note": " The causes of incisional hernia are the same as those of burst abdomen. Actually these are two grades of wound failure. As a matter of fact, many patients with incisional hernia had partial disruption of the deeper layers of the abdominal wound during the early post-operative period. The presence of any prosthetic material in a wound increases the incidence of infection and makes its eradication very difficult, except after its removal. Wound infection is the commonest cause of incisional hernia formation. Small wound haematomas should be left undisturbed and the body will absorb them without ill effects. Keloid formation is far more prevalent in people with dark skin. ",

Hypokalaemia also raises intra-abdominal pressure by causing bowel distension that may amount to paralytic ileus. Cushing's syndrome is characterized by excess glucocorticoid release in the circulation. These steroids are known to impair wound healing. Prolonged corticosteroid therapy produces the same effect.

    "note": " Practically all abdominal operations can. be done by laparoscopy. Even abdominal wall hernias can be repaired laparoscopically. The peritoneal cavity is inflated with gas in order to allow Safe introduction of instruments, the abdominal wall being lifted away from the viscera. Some distance between the telescope tip and the viscera in order to permit visualization. Working space that permits free movements of instruments. Carbon dioxide is an inert gas that allows safe use of electrocautery. It is, therefore, the standard choice for creating pneumoperitoneum. Previous abdominal surgery is not a contraindication but needs more caution while doing laparoscopy. This is because intestinal adhesions to the abdominal wall are likely to be present. There are ways to avoid intestinal injury in such cases. Examples are: Insufflate the abdomen and introduce the first trocar away from the scar. Access the peritoneal cavity by a small incision in order to place the first trocar under direct vision. Use an optical trocar. Laparoscopy certainly causes much less pain than laparotomy. The advantages are: Less need for analgesia. Early ambulation that reduces the incidence of deep vein thrombosis. Better ability to cough that reduces the incidence of atelectasis. Shorter hospital stay. Early return to work.",

This is why it has no place in modern surgical practice. Repair without tension requires the use of a synthetic mesh to bridge the defect. It acts as scaffolding that permits growth of fibrous tissue through its pores. An absorbable mesh, like polygalactin provides short-term support only.

A thyroglossal cyst may be present at any level from the foramen caecum of tongue to the suprasternal notch, usually in the mid line just below the hyoid bone except at the level of the thyroid cartilage, where it is displaced usually to the left. A thyroglossal fistula is always acquired, though it has a congenital basis. The development of a fistula follows either spontaneous rupture or incision and drainage of infected thyroglossal cyst.

If a parathyroid gland is inadvertently removed, it should be immediately cut into 1mm pieces and implanted in pockets in the sternomastoid muscle. The old teaching of thyroidectomy recommended that the inferior thyroid arteries are to be ligated away from the thyroid gland in order to avoid injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. We now realize that this technique exposes the parathyroids to ischaemia because the inferior thyroid artery is usually the main blood supply of the parathyroids. The modern recommendation is to ligate and divide the tertiary branches of the artery just on the surface of the thyroid, i.e., after the take off of the parathyroid branches. The condition usually presents between days 2-5 after the operation, and sometimes earlier. The earliest symptom of hypocalcaemia is circumoral and peripheral numbness. Latent tetany can be revealed by inflating the sphygmomanometer cuff around the arm (Trosseau's sign). This stage should be treated with oral calcium and vitamin D3. Left untreated the patient develops tetany in the form of carpopedal spasm; a condition that requires the addition of IV calcium.",

Furthermore, if the patient is in hypovolaemic shock laparoscopy is contraindicated as gas insufflation of the peritoneum compresses the inferior vena cava and dangerously reduces venous return. On the other hand, laparoscopy is a good approach to peptic ulcer perforation. Another difference between surgery for perforation and that for bleeding is the addition of a definitive procedure for ulcer treatment. For a bleeding ulcer, the distal stomach and first part of duodenum are opened along their axis to expose the bleeder which is underrun with sutures. A truncal vagotomy is done. The gastro-duodenal incision is closed in the opposite direction to provide wide gastric drainage. The definitive operation is, thus, truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty. This addition is better avoided in cases of perforation because the patient with peritonitis is less able to stand a long procedure.

If the tumour is present in the distal part of the organ, removal of a safety margin still allows retaining the proximal part of the stomach, the operation is subtotal radical gastrectomy. The lesser and greater omenta have to be removed in a radical operation as the draining lymph nodes lie on the lesser and greater curvatures within these omenta.

A colostomy is an incontinent stoma that requires fitting of a colostomy bag to collect stools. The confusion comes from the fact that sometimes a continent ileostostomy can be fashioned. A valve is made in the ileal lumen at its exit on the skin to prevent passage of its fluid content. Evacuation is possible only by passing a catheter to overcome this valve. Two types of hernia can occur in relation to a colostomy. A paracolostomy hernia is an external hernia that bulges on the anterior abdominal wall through the muscular defect that allows passage of the colon. An internal hernia can also occur if the surgeon fails to close the space lateral to the exiting colon between it and the parietal peritoneum.",

Contrast radiography is the method of choice for detecting the origin of the fistula on the bowel side. If it is suspected to be of small intestinal origin, a barium meal with follow through is done. If suspected to be of colonic origin a barium enema is preferred. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor alpha. It proved useful in helping spontaneous closure of Crohn's fistulas.",

There may be a band that connects the diverticulum with the umbilicus. This band may allow rotation of the ileum around its axis (volvulus). Removal of a Meckel's diverticulum should include a rim of adjacent bowel in order to remove any heterotopic epithelium.

    "note": " The internal anal sphincter is the thickened extension of inner circular muscle layer of the rectum. Hence, it is formed of involuntary visceral muscles that are under autonomic control. It contributes about 80% of the resting anal canal pressure. The puborectalis muscle forms a sling that pulls the anorectal junction forwards to maintain its right angle. This is an important mechanism that maintains continence. In response to rectal distension by stools or flatus, the internal sphincter relaxes allowing a small sample of these rectal contents to enter the upper anal canal. The sensitive epithelium in this area can discern its type whether it being flatus, liquid, or solid stools. If the circumstances are convenient, the subject relaxes the puborectalis thus widening the anorectal angle, and also relaxes the external sphincter. Straining will expel the rectal contents to the outside. If the subject does not wish to evacuate the rectum, the puborectalis and the external sphincter contract to push the sample of luminal contents upwards.",

An acute fissure has neither sentinel pile nor hypertrophied anal papilla. These are features of a chronic fissure. The great majority of acute fissures can be treated conservatively by Local anaesthetic creams Topical creams that relax the internal sphincter as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) 0.2% applied four times per day to the anal margin (although this may cause headaches) and diltiazem 2% applied twice daily.

A chronic fissure produces spasm of the internal sphincter; but it is not as intense as that cause by an acute fissure. This moderate sphincter spasm does not prevent visualization of the longitudinal crack when the edges of the anal verge are gently parted away. By far, the commonest site is the midline posteriorly. An anterior midline fissure is less common and is more frequently seen in females than in males. A chronic fissure is characterized by induration (as a result of fibrosis). It may also have a sentinel pile at its lower end (at anal verge) and a hypertrophied anal papilla at its upper end. A chronic fissure responds less favourably to conservative treatment that was described for an acute one. However, conservative treatment should be offered because if strictly followed it heals a large number of cases. In case of failure, the usual operation is lateral internal sphincterotomy. The spastic lower part of internal sphincter is divided in either the left or the right lateral position. This brings immediate marked reduction of pain and allows healing of the fissure.",

They are probably as good as rubber band ligation for first-degree cases, but for second degree cases band ligation is superior.

In patients with haemolytic disorders the liver is healthy and vitamin K is normally absorbed from the intestine. In addition to the formation of prothrombin, another synthetic function of the liver is the formation of albumin. Consequently, liver cirrhosis patients are prone to have hypoprothrombinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia.

    "note": " The main danger of liver injury is bleeding. However, minor injuries can stop bleeding spontaneously. Provided there is close clinical, laboratory and imaging follow-up, a stable patient with isolated minor liver injury can be treated conservatively. Pringle's manoeuvre is temporary control of the structures at the free border of lesser omentum. This is achieved either with a vascular clamp or with the surgeon's fingers. Flow in the main two sources of blood to the liver; namely the hepatic artery and the portal vein is stopped. This manoeuvre allows the surgeon to localize bleeding points and to control them. Firm packing of liver lacerations is a useful method in the haemodynamically unstable patient. It controls bleeding in a short time. The patient is then transferred to ICU for stabilization. Within 24-48 hours a stable patient is returned to the operating theatre for removal of the packs and definitive control of bleeding. This is an example of a policy that is called \"damage control surgery\", a policy that results in better survival of the severely injured trauma victim. If possible, suturing a liver tear is better avoided as blood accumulates in the resulting cavity and can get access to torn bile ducts. The resulting haemobilia can cause biliary obstruction.",

This is explained by the fact that the pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ whose inflammation causes little irritation to the sensitive anterior parietal peritoneum. Shock is a feature of severe acute pancreatitis because there is trans peritoneal loss of a large volume of protein-rich exudates. Multiple organ failure, particularly ARDS, is the cause of death in the early phase (7 days). Infective complications are the cause of death in the late phase. The severity of acute pancreatitis does not decide the need for surgery. Treatment of acute pancreatitis is essentially conservative. The indications for surgery are limited and include Doubtful diagnosis where other causes of acute abdomen cannot be excluded. Examples include suspicion of acute intestinal ischaemia and perforated duodenal ulcer. A laparotomy for acute pancreatitis does not worsen the prognosis.

It is elevated in other conditions as perforated peptic ulcer, acute cholecystitis, intestinal obstruction and acute mesenteric ischaemia. The enzyme level in these cases, however, usually does not exceed 500 IU/dL. As this enzyme is cleared out by the kidney, urinary amylase level can be used for diagnosis of patients who present after two days of the start of pain. Pancreatic necrosis is diagnosed when a big part of the parenchyma is not enhanced after IV contrast injection. The presence of necrosis is a strong indicator of severity of the attack.

It may even be subhepatic. Acute inflammation in these cases makes the maximum point of tenderness to be present higher than McBurney's. Rigidity is a feature of peritonitis due to rupture of the appendix. In uncomplicated cases there is tenderness in the right lower quadrant but no rigidity. A normal leucocyte count does not exclude appendicitis. On the other hand, a high count with shift to the left supports the clinical diagnosis. Abdominal ultrasound may diagnose appendicitis in only a few cases where the appendix appears distended and non-compressible.

Testosterone production is not affected by the abnormal position of the testes and surgery has no effect on their hormonal function. Testicular torsion and strangulation of a concomitant hernia are possible complications of undescended testes. As herniotomy is a part of the operation, orchidopexy eliminates both complications. Undescended testes are more prone to malignant transformation than the normally-situated ones. Orchidopexy reduces this tendency but does not eliminate it. The good thing is that orchidopexy facilitates early detection if it happens. ",

It is possible to transplant one half of a liver, either the right or the left lobe, because each has its separate arterial, portal, systemic venous and biliary systems. A cadaver liver, therefore, can be used for two recipients. Also, living-related transplantation is possible. The donor can live normally with a half liver. Furthermore, the remaining healthy liver has a remarkable ability for regeneration, thus adding a substantial amount of hepatic cells. Transplantation for primary liver cancer has a lower survival rate because immunosuppression leads to early recurrence. Patients with advanced disease are not candidates for transplantation. Early HCC cases, however, can sometimes be transplanted, but the selection of such patients is subjected to very strict criteria.",

It also provides a rough idea about the separate functions of each kidney. In a normal kidney a renal blush (contrast that is filtered in the cortical tubules) shows within one minute of IV injection of the contrast. The calyces and renal pelvis start to appear within five minutes and the ureters start to show at 10-13 minutes of injection. In a kidney with impaired function these intervals are prolonged. The delay is roughly proportionate to the degree of renal functional impairment. CT is far better than IVU in the diagnosis and staging of hypernephroma. Emergency IVU is useful in the diagnosis of patients with renal colic, though this is now superseded with spiral CT scan (without contrast), which is better able to detect small stones.

The ulnar nerve is prone to injury with fractures of the medial epicondyle. This produces clawing of the medial two fingers as the corresponding lumbrical muscles are paralysed. The circumflex (axillary) nerve passes posterior to the surgical neck of humerus. Its fracture can cause nerve injury with consequent paralysis and atrophy of the deltoid muscle. The capsule of hip joint is an important landmark in the prognosis of femoral neck fractures. An extracapsular fracture does not affect the vascularity of the neck. An intracapsular fracture, however, can interrupt its blood supply and cause head necrosis if it is markedly displaced. Therefore, for necrosis of head of femur to occur, the fracture should be intracapsular and displaced. Supracondylar fractures of the femur can injure the popliteal artery and cause acute ischaemia and blood loss.",

Internal fixation allows early mobilization and reduces the risks of venous thrombosis, chest infection and decubitus ulcer formation. Ankle fractures are indicated for open reduction and internal fixation in order to avoid any irregularity of the articular surface, a condition that causes osteoarthritis and chronic pain in this weight-bearing joint. As a general rule arterial repair requires rigid fixation of the fracture that caused it. Otherwise, the vascular repair is threatened by failure. The femoral shaft is surrounded by strong muscles that can re-displace the fracture if it is fixed in plaster. Traction requires lying down in a hospital bed for a long time. Internal metal fixation solves these problems. Internal fixation is generally contraindicated in cases of compound fractures. These fractures are contaminated. The insertion of a metal prosthesis in such a wound promotes infection. If rigid immobilization is required, external metal fixation is a suitable alternative.  ",
